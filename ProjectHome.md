Welcome to Fizzix, a physics engine with fairly undetermined laws of physics. Fizzix allows the user to change the laws of physics and just see what happens. Gravity as G*M1*M2*R instead of G*M1*M2/R^2? A force that attracts things together if they're pink? How about F = omega<code>*</code>(foo1-foo2)? No problem! We might want to keep it in 4 dimensions, though.<br>
<br>
Fizzix was conceived by Anton F., Joey L., Daniel S., Purnima B., and Eric VA. for their software design class at Montgomery Blair High School.<br>
