Welcome to Fizzix, a physics engine with fairly undetermined laws of physics.

Fizzix allows the user to change the laws of physics and just see what happens. Gravity as `G*M1*M2*R` instead of `G*M1*M2/R^2`? A force that attracts things together if they're pink? How about `F = omega*(foo1-foo2)`? No problem! We might want to keep it in 4 dimensions, though.

Fizzix was conceived by Anton F., Joey L., Daniel S., Purnima B., and Eric VA. for their software design class at Montgomery Blair High School.
