To install cxxtest on a linux machine:

cd into the top directory labeled cxxtest.  You should see another directory called cxxtest, a python script (.py), and a perl script (.pl), but no headers.  Then,

cd /usr/include/c++

go into the highest numbered folder name, and remember the path to this place.  Go back to the top level of the cxxtest stuff, and execture:

sudo cp -rf cxxtest <filepath>, where filepath is the one you just found.

If you want to be able to use the generating scripts (the .py or .pl files you see) as a command, rather than having to cd into the cxxfolder every time, do:

sudo cp cxxtestgen.py /usr/bin/cxxtestgen.  (This may not be recommended, but I did it cause I'm lazy.)

Then, go to http://cxxtest.sourceforge.net/guide.html for instructinos on how to use cxxtest.
